	<h3>Harmonics club is a club exclusive to Suankularb Wittayalai Schol. It is a club that is all about enjoying music and creating bands. This club helps people to get to know each other more. It is provides members with alot of instruments to use ranging from guitars to drums. Now the definiton of harmonics is any member of the harmonic series. The term is employed in various disciplines, including music, physics, acoustics, electronic power transmission, radio technology, and other fields. It is typically applied to repeating signals, such as sinusoidal waves. A harmonic of such a wave is a wave with a frequency that is a positive integer multiple of the frequency of the original wave, known as the fundamental frequency. The original wave is also called the 1st harmonic, the following harmonics are known as higher harmonics. As all harmonics are periodic at the fundamental frequency, the sum of harmonics is also periodic at that frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency is 50 Hz, a common AC power supply frequency, the frequencies of the first three higher harmonics are 100 Hz (2nd harmonic), 150 Hz (3rd harmonic), 200 Hz (4th harmonic) and any addition of waves with these frequencies is periodic at 50 Hz. It would make sense to how this group got it's name. The function like a band with an exception of far more members</h3>
	<h3 style = "color:#0FD3D5">**Harmonic members are only allowed to practice either early in the morning (5:30 - 7:20 am) or after school (4:30 - 6:00 pm) due to noises that could cause distraction during studying time.**</h3>
