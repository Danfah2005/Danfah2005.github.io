	<h3>An event is something that happens, especially when it is unusual or important. You can use events to describe all the things that are happening in a particular situation. As you might have already guessed, Harmonic club tackles all of musical-related events such as charities, Samarnmitr, Activity Day and a whole lot of special events. Now when this group shines is during the Samarnmitr Event. Samarnmitr event is an event that graduates and people who are already studying in Suankularb come to meet each other at the Suankularb Wittayalai School. Hence the name, "Samarnmitr", which means to reunite friendships. Harmonics club's role during this time was to perform live music. We choose some of the best players in our groups and form a band that plays various genres of music ranging from Pop to metal. Other events will roughly be the same but it has a less significance when compared to Samarnmitr Day. Activity day is a day that this group gets to promote itself. We once again choose players that are some of the best in our group and form them a band. During Activity Day, we will try to persuade people to join our group. We also play alot of music genres ranging from Pop to Metal. We also do charity works too raise funds for that charity. How we funds ourselves is through public performences or being hired. These funds are then used to better our group and buy and improve instruments.</h3>
